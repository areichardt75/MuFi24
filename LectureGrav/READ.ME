Problems using solution of gravitational force acting between masses

#1. Solution of two-body problem / Big central mass (M) placed in origo 
- mass (m) is started at (x0,y0) with velocity (vx0, vy0) 
- calculation from 0 to Tmax 
- plotting results, real space trajectory, phase space trajectory, potential energy and force visualization 

#2. Double-star problem /
Given two stars (M1 and M2), separated by d distance
